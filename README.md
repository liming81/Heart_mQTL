The files provided here are  were related to manuscript, entitled "Mapping methylation quantitative trait loci in cardiac tissues nominates risk loci and biological pathways 
in congenital heart disease", submitted for publication in BMC Genomic Data. 

The study aim to identify methylation quantitative trait loci within cardiac tissue samples, and prioritized the findings by leveraging results from other sources, 
including genome-wide association study of congenital heart defects and Genotype-Tissue Expression database. 
The results support the hypothesis that genetic variants may influence the risk of disease through regulating the changes of DNA methylation and gene expression.

The files include:


Supplementary Table S1 
List of mQTL identified. 

Supplementary Table S2 
CpG sites identified with potential causal effect on CHD risk by Two-sample Mendelian Randomization.

Supplementary Table S3 
Association between GWAS identified SNPs (Lupo et al. 2019) and nearby CpG sites. 

R codes for data analysis using existing methods. The R codes depend on the orignial data used in the manuscript and are not directly applicable to other studies. The original data includes protected health information collected from cardiac tissue samples. 
We have to go through the de-identification and IRB approval process before the data can be shared. The datasets will be deposited to DbGap following NIH data sharing guidelines.
